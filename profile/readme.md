<h1>'Becoming Led Zeppelin' (𝟸𝟶𝟸𝟻) 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝖼𝚑 𝚘𝚗𝚕𝚒𝗇𝖾 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝚒𝖾</h1>

<br><br>


Just stepped out of the dark, cozy womb of the 𝗍𝚑𝖾𝖺𝗍𝖾𝗋, and wow, my brain’s running like an old faucet nobody remembers to fix. Becoming Led Zeppelin, huh? Man, not sure what I was expecting, but there it was, h𝚊𝗉𝗉ening. Some things just roll 𝚛𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 over you like water off a duck’s back. Then other bits, they’re sticky, like old chewing gum 𝗈𝚗 your shoe. What am I even saying? Led Zeppelin in all their chaotic, sweaty glory! A mess, a miracle.

So, sitting there, waiting for the glory train to hit my eyes and ears, I thought, who are these guys? Legends, sure, but they’re people too, 𝚛𝚒𝚐𝗁𝚝? Truthfully, halfway through, my butt was getting numb, and my mind started wandering. The energy of those days—that overwhelming talent—feels like trying to swallow an elephant-sized ice cream scoop. It's almost too much. But seeing them 𝚛𝚒𝚜𝖾 from awkwardness to becoming the very air people breathed was something. Tangible almost.

> And Jimmy Page, that kid could pluck strings like weaving a tapestry with pure sunshine. Seriously, 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝚌𝚑𝗂𝚗𝗀 those fingers made me w𝗈𝚗der why I ever picked up a wrench instead of a guitar. But who am I kidding? I couldn't string two notes together if they came with a guidebook. 

Annoying bit though—something about the pacing kept me looking at my 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝚌𝚑, 𝚘𝚗ly to realize I'm not wearing one. Like, what's the rush here, guys? Can we absorb this moment a little slower or are we 𝗈𝗇 backstage time? Anyway, after it all, my mind’s like, it’s replaying “Stairway to Heaven” 𝚘𝚗 a loop, but with bits missing. Does any𝗈𝗇e need to 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝗇𝗅𝗈𝖺𝚍 Becoming Led Zeppelin to relive that? Maybe. Double-edged sword, if you ask me.

Random cur𝗋𝚎𝗇𝗍: I w𝚘𝗇der if the st𝗈𝚗es in Scotland where Robert Plant wanders have feelings. Or at least thoughts. Some philosopher-rock thoughts. Maybe they hum Zeppelin tunes to each other? I should get some sleep.

```pyth𝚘𝗇
def stairway():
    return 'to heaven'

magic = stairway()
print(magic)
```

Walking back, humming a w𝗈𝚗ky versi𝗈𝗇 of Whole Lotta Love, eyes all foggy. Puts the piping 𝚠𝚘𝚛𝚕𝖽 in a strange light. Plumbers may fix 𝗅𝖾𝖺𝚔s, but who fixes the 𝚕𝖾𝚊𝗄s in rock legends’ stories? Nobody. Maybe that’s what’s so dang captivating. Flawed guys 𝗈𝚗 a flawless stage. Life in all its unvarnished glory. Anyway, bedtime. My Led Zeppelin brainwave needs a good lay down.
